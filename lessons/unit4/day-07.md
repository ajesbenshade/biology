# Day 7: Review Chapter 12 + Biotechnology Introduction

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Evaluate biotechnology tools and inheritance evidence while applying biblical stewardship in ethical decision-making.

**Key Terms:** PCR, gel electrophoresis, CRISPR, stewardship, bioethics

**Core Science Content:**
- Biotechnology overview: PCR amplification, DNA separation, targeted edits
- Review of inheritance laws and data interpretation boundaries

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Interpret gel band distances and infer fragment size relationships

<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:11-12, 21, 24-25</strong> and <strong>Genesis 1:28</strong></p>
<p>Biotechnology gives humans powerful tools to investigate and steward life, but data still describe variation and inheritance within biological kinds. Academic integrity requires interpreting evidence carefully while practicing responsible dominion.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> What evidence from biotechnology labs supports careful stewardship without claiming kind-to-kind transformation?</p>
</div>

**Objectives:**
- Review inheritance.
- Introduce gene editing as responsible use of God-given tools.

**Materials:**
- MindTap CRISPR video.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
What is one ethical issue in gene editing?

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Debate pros and cons of biotechnology.
2. Emphasize stewardship, not playing God.

**Assessment:**
Chapter 12 Quiz.
