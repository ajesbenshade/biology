# Day 2: DNA Structure & Replication – Faithful Copying by the Creator

**Scripture Focus:** Colossians 1:17 – “In him all things hold together.”

**Objectives:**
- Model DNA double helix.
- Explain semi-conservative replication.
- Appreciate replication fidelity as God’s sustaining power.

**Materials:**
- Pipe cleaners/straws for models.
- Strawberry DNA extraction supplies.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
Sketch and label a simple DNA strand from memory.

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Review Day 1.
2. Hands-on model building.
3. Mini-lab: Extract DNA from strawberries (visible “code” of life). Discuss: Mutations are rare because God designed stability.

**Classwork/Homework:**
Replication flowchart and 5 review questions.

**Exit Ticket:**
“What would happen if replication were not accurate?”
