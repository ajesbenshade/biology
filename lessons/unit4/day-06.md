# Day 6: Human Genetics & Pedigrees

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Construct pedigrees and evaluate inheritance evidence while recognizing human life as intentionally formed and uniquely valuable.

**Key Terms:** pedigree, carrier, autosomal, sex-linked, mutation, loss-of-function

**Core Science Content:**
- Pedigree symbols and inheritance tracking
- Mutation categories and likely phenotypic effects

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Probability calculations for inheritance outcomes in pedigree cases

<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Job 10:8-12</strong> — “Your hands shaped me and made me... you knit me together with bones and sinews.”</p>
<p>Human genetics reveals both remarkable order and the effects of biological brokenness. In most observed cases, mutations reduce or disrupt existing function, reinforcing the reality that living systems are designed and delicate.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> How does a pedigree showing a harmful mutation support both scientific analysis and the biblical view of human dignity?</p>
</div>

**Objectives:**
- Construct and analyze pedigrees.
- Discuss genetic disorders as a result of sin’s curse (Romans 8:22).

**Materials:**
- Pedigree worksheets.
- National Geographic case study.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
Analyze a simple pedigree chart provided.

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Pedigree construction.
2. Group activity on disorders.
3. Biblical tie: All humans share common ancestry in Adam and Eve.

**Classwork/Homework:**
Short research summary on one disorder.
