- Flowchart handout.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
“How does DNA ‘tell’ a cell to make a protein?”

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Video and guided notes.
2. Flowchart construction.
3. Creationist discussion: The universal genetic code is evidence of one Creator, not multiple origins.

Protein synthesis practice problems.

**Exit Ticket:**
Write one benefit of precise gene expression in living things.
