# Day 3: Gene Expression & Protein Synthesis – The Central Dogma

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Model DNA structure and explain how transcription and translation convert coded information into functional proteins while recognizing purposeful design.

**Key Terms:** double helix, nucleotide, base-pairing, replication fork, helicase, DNA polymerase, transcription, translation, codon, anticodon

**Core Science Content:**
- Watson-Crick model and complementary base-pairing (A-T, C-G)
- DNA replication overview and enzyme roles
- Central dogma flow: DNA -> RNA -> protein

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Calculate replication error rates from sample data tables
- Compare with enzyme proofreading rates from class simulation

<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Psalm 139:13-16 (NIV)</strong> — “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb... I am fearfully and wonderfully made...”</p>
<p>The double helix is a four-letter information system with proofreading that achieves extraordinary fidelity. This precision mirrors the Psalmist’s image of God “knitting” life with intention and care.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> How does the replication fidelity measured in class support the Psalm 139 picture of intentional design?</p>

**Materials:**
- MindTap central-dogma video.
- Flowchart handout.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
“How does DNA ‘tell’ a cell to make a protein?”

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Video and guided notes.
2. Flowchart construction.
3. Creationist discussion: The universal genetic code is evidence of one Creator, not multiple origins.

**Classwork/Homework:**
Protein synthesis practice problems.

**Exit Ticket:**
Write one benefit of precise gene expression in living things.
