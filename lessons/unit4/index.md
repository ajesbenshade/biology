# Unit 4: Genetics

## Academic Excellence Focus (Core, Non-Negotiable)

- Mendelian ratios with chi-square analysis
- Meiosis/mitosis comparison with labeled diagrams
- DNA structure and replication (Watson-Crick model; leading/lagging strands; key enzymes)
- Transcription and translation with codon-table practice
- Gene regulation and mutations (point vs. frameshift)
- Biotechnology foundations (PCR, gel electrophoresis, CRISPR basics)
- Pedigree analysis and probability calculations

## Scripture Integration Approach

Each daily summary includes a boxed **Scripture Connection** with:
- A relevant verse
- A 2–3 sentence insight tied directly to measured scientific evidence
- One synthesis question requiring both data and biblical reflection

## Assessment Weighting

- **60% Objective:** tests, Punnett square mastery, data analysis, graphing
- **40% Application:** lab reports and claim-evaluation writing using data + Scripture
