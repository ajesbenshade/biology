# Day 4: Mendelian Inheritance – Laws of Heredity Within Kinds

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Analyze inheritance patterns with Punnett models and chi-square testing while distinguishing variation within kinds from claims of kind-to-kind transformation.

**Key Terms:** allele, genotype, phenotype, dominant, recessive, monohybrid, F1, F2, chi-square

**Core Science Content:**
- Mendelian inheritance and expected 3:1 monohybrid ratios
- Biological variation within created kinds

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Calculate expected ratios and run chi-square goodness-of-fit for class data

<div class="scripture-connection">
<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:11-12, 21, 24-25</strong> — repeated pattern “according to their kinds.”</p>
<p>Mendelian genetics demonstrates orderly inheritance and real variation, while preserving biological boundaries in observed populations. Students use chi-square to test whether data fit expected laws rather than assuming conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> What does your chi-square result suggest about inheritance predictability and variation within kinds?</p>
</div>

**Materials:**
- Punnett square worksheets.
- Coin-flip simulation.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
Predict offspring of tall/short pea plants (simple example provided).

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Mendel review via National Geographic.
2. Practice crosses.
3. Worldview: Variation within kinds shows God’s provision for diversity, not new kinds.

**Classwork/Homework:**
10 monohybrid problems.

**Assessment:**
Chapter 11 Quiz (last 20 min).
