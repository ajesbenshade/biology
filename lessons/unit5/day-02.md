# Day 2: Lines of Evidence – Fossils & Anatomy

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Analyze fossil and structural datasets and distinguish data description from worldview interpretation.

**Key Terms:** fossil succession, homologous structure, analogous structure, adaptation, selection pressure

**Core Science Content:**
- Evidence categories used in historical biology arguments
- Structure-function comparisons and environment-linked adaptation

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Create a simple frequency chart from anatomy comparison data

<div class="scripture-connection">
<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Psalm 104:24, 27-30</strong> — “How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all...”</p>
<p>Observable adaptation can be modeled quantitatively as populations respond to changing conditions. This process can be understood as a sustaining mechanism in creation rather than a creative force generating entirely new kinds.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> How do your fossil/anatomy data support adaptation in changing environments while preserving careful claims about what the data can and cannot prove?</p>
</div>

**Objectives:**
- Evaluate fossil record and homologous structures from a creation perspective.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
Sketch a simple fossil record timeline.

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Compare homologous structures.
2. Discuss rapid burial in the Flood as an explanation for fossil order.

**Classwork/Homework:**
Questions on vestigial organs.
