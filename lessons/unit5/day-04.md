# Day 4: Natural Selection & Adaptation

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Model natural selection quantitatively and evaluate adaptation outcomes within created populations.

**Key Terms:** natural selection, allele frequency, adaptation, selection coefficient, survival curve

**Core Science Content:**
- Selection pressure and trait distribution changes
- Finch and moth case studies as within-population adaptation

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Graph survival rates and allele frequency shifts across simulated generations

<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Psalm 104:24, 27-30</strong></p>
<p>Natural selection can be observed as a sorting process under environmental pressure. Students should describe this as measurable adaptation while carefully distinguishing it from claims that require additional assumptions beyond the data.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> In your simulation, what changed, what stayed stable, and how does that sharpen your definition of adaptation?</p>
</div>

**Objectives:**
- Model natural selection using a simulation.
- Explain selection as God-designed conservation of kinds.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
Predict how a population might adapt to drought.

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Peppered moth simulation (online or hands-on).
2. Data analysis and discussion.

**Assessment:**
Chapter 14 Quiz.
