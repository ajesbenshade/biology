<h3>Scripture Connection (Capstone)</h3>
<p>The unit closes by connecting scientific mechanisms with theological coherence: systems are analyzable because creation is ordered and sustained. Students demonstrate both scientific precision and worldview clarity in their final reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> Choose one environmental or genetic system from Unit 5 and explain both the mechanism and how Colossians 1:16-17 frames its purpose.</p>
