# Day 3: Molecular & Developmental Evidence

**Objective (NGSS-style + creation lens):** Compare molecular data sets and evaluate competing interpretations (common design vs. common descent) using evidence-based reasoning.

**Key Terms:** sequence alignment, cytochrome c, conserved region, developmental pathway, inference

**Core Science Content:**
- DNA/protein sequence comparison methods
- Similarity metrics and interpretation limits

**Math/Graphing Practice:**
- Compute percent similarity and visualize with a bar graph

<h3>Scripture Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Romans 8:19-22</strong> — creation in “bondage to decay.”</p>
<p>Molecular evidence is real and measurable; interpretation requires caution. Students compare how the same dataset can be framed as common design or common descent and defend conclusions with explicit evidence claims.</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis Question:</strong> Which interpretation does your dataset support most strongly, and what assumptions are required?</p>
</div>

**Objectives:**
- Analyze DNA similarity within kinds as evidence of common design, not common descent.

**Bell Work (10 min):**
How does DNA support common ancestry?

**Lesson (70 min):**
1. Sequence comparison exercise.
2. Tie to genetics from Unit 4.

**Classwork/Homework:**
Complete analysis questions on gene sequences.
