# Unit 5: Evolution and Changing Environments

## Academic Excellence Focus (Core, Non-Negotiable)

- Mechanisms of microevolution: natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation
- Quantitative examples: peppered moth allele frequencies, antibiotic resistance
- Fossil record analysis and environmental change interpretation
- Homologous vs. analogous structures
- Molecular evidence: cytochrome c and DNA sequence comparisons
- Speciation models (allopatric/sympatric) discussed within biblical kinds framework
- Climate and ecosystem data interpreted with stewardship application

## Scripture Integration Approach

Scripture is used to illuminate purpose and sovereignty, not to avoid scientific analysis. Each daily page includes a boxed **Scripture Connection** with verse, insight, and synthesis prompt.

## Unit Capstone Verse

Colossians 1:16-17 — “All things have been created through Him and for Him… in Him all things hold together.”
