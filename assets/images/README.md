Place your official logo image files in this folder.

- `logo.png` — full logo (recommended width ~600px, PNG or WebP)
- `logo-small.png` — optional small variant for mobile (recommended width ~200px)

You attached a logo in the chat. If you'd like me to add it to this repo, reply "Add attached logo" and I'll save it as `assets/images/logo.png` and update the header to use it.
