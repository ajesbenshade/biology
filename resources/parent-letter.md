# Parent Letter

Dear Parents,

Welcome to Biology at Dock Mennonite High School! This course is designed to provide students with a rigorous understanding of biology while viewing God’s creation through Scripture. We will explore:

- **Unit 4: Genetics** – DNA as evidence of intelligent design, inheritance patterns, and biotechnology stewardship.
- **Unit 5: Evolution** – Adaptation and biodiversity within created kinds, and the role of humans as stewards of God’s creation.

Our goal is to inspire students to marvel at God’s intricate design while meeting academic standards. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.

Blessings,
[Your Name]
