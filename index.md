# Welcome — Biology with Aaron Esbenshade

I teach high-school biology (freshmen) with an emphasis on academic excellence and a biblical, creation-centered perspective. This site provides concise daily lesson summaries, study guides, and resources for Units 4 (Genetics) and 5 (Evolution & Changing Environments). We celebrate God’s design in living systems while practicing careful scientific thinking and stewardship.
