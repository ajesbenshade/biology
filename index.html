                <p class="title">Biology Teacher &mdash; Dock Mennonite High School</p>
                <p>
                    Hello, students and families! I am so excited to have you in Biology this year.
                    This course will take us on an incredible journey through the science of life &mdash;
                    from the tiniest cells to entire ecosystems. My goal is to make science engaging,
                    relevant, and even a little surprising!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this class you will ask big questions, conduct hands-on investigations, and
                    develop skills that will serve you well in whatever path you choose after high school.
                    I believe every student can succeed in science, and I am here to support you every step
                    of the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions &mdash; my door (and inbox) is always open.
                </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Background &amp; Education</h3>
        <p>
            I have a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a Master of Arts in Teaching. Before coming to Dock
            Mennonite, I spent time working in field ecology and environmental education, which means I bring
            real-world science experience into our classroom every day.
        </p>

        <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            I believe learning happens best through curiosity, collaboration, and hands-on exploration.
            In my classroom, mistakes are celebrated as part of the learning process, and questions are
            always welcome. Science is not just a collection of facts — it is a way of understanding the
            world, and I want students to leave this class thinking like scientists.
        </p>
